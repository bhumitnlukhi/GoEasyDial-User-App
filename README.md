This might be overkill, but this is the best way I know to perform the cleanest pod install and ensure that you have no lingering pod cache issues or misconfigured Xcode settings:

cd ios
rm -rf Podfile.lock
rm -rf Pods
rm -rf pubspec.lock
pod repo update
pod cache clean --all
pod deintegrate
pod setup
pod install --repo-update




flutter build apk --target-platform android-arm,android-arm64,android-x64 --split-per-abi

flutter run -d chrome --web-hostname localhost --web-port 5000
